I am an Assistant Professor at [Rutgers University Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/). My research focuses on natural language processing, with an emphasis on Responsible AI. I work on problems relating to fairness, trustworthiness, and safety. In addition to these topics, I am also interested in model reasoning and human-AI collaboration. My research is interdisciplinary and I have worked with academics in other disciplines, such as public health, gender studies, and political science.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Mark Dredze and Michelle Kaufman. I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of California Santa Barbara, where I worked with Professor William Wang.
